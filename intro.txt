1. graphql deals with the problem of overfetching or underfetching data in case of rest API 

2. Whenever we send a graphql request to server it is typically done by single endpoint which would look like mysite.com/graphql 

3. graphql allows us to fetch nested related data

4. query ReviewQuery{
    reviews{
        rating,
        content,
        id
    }
}
  We will only get rating, content, id of reviews 

5. npm pkg set type="module"

6. adding exclamation mark in schema makes it required field

7. type query is used to define entry points to the graph and every schema should have it 

8. resolvers handle any incoming requests and return the appropriate data

9. to fetch only 1 id, platform or anything we need to use Query Variables

10. we need to define relationships in our schema so that apollo knows to make our graph that way
