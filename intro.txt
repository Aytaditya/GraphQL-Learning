1. graphql deals with the problem of overfetching or underfetching data in case of rest API 

2. Whenever we send a graphql request to server it is typically done by single endpoint which would look like mysite.com/graphql 

3. graphql allows us to fetch nested related data

4. query ReviewQuery{
    reviews{
        rating,
        content,
        id
    }
}
  We will only get rating, content, id of reviews 

5. npm pkg set type="module"
